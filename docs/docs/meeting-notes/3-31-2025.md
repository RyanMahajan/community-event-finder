### 2. **React Native**

-   **What it is:** React Native is a popular framework that allows you to write mobile apps using JavaScript and React, but it compiles down to native code.
    
-   **How to do it:**
    
    -   Develop your app using **React Native** to build native iOS and Android apps.
        
    -   It uses JavaScript for the logic and React components, while the rendering is handled by native views.
        
-   **Pros:**
    
    -   It allows for a native experience while writing code in JavaScript.
        
    -   React Native apps are faster than traditional WebView apps.
        
    -   There's a large community and a lot of resources for building apps.
        
-   **Cons:**
    
    -   Requires knowledge of native development for debugging and optimization.
        
    -   Some native modules might require you to use Swift or Objective-C for specific functionality.
